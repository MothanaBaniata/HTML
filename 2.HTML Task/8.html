                <p><mark>Coding is the composition of sequences of instructions,
                        called
                        programs</mark>, that computers can follow to perform
                    tasks. It
                    involves
                    designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step
                    <br>specifications
                    of procedures, by writing code in one or more programming
                    languages.
                    Programmers typically use high-level programming languages
                    that are
                    more easily intelligible to human <br>than machine code,
                    which is
                    directly executed by the central processing unit. Proficient
                    programming usually requires expertise in several different
                    subjects, including knowledge of the <br>application domain,
                    details
                    of
                    programming languages and generic code libraries,
                    specialized
                    algorithms, and formal logic. Auxiliary tasks accompanying
                    and
                    related to programming include <br>analyzing requirements,
                    testing,
                    debugging (investigating and fixing problems),
                    <u>implementation of
                        build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such
                        as
                        programs' machine code.</u>

                <p>While these are sometimes considered programming, often the
                    term
                    software development is used for this larger overall process
                    with
                    the terms programming, implementation, and coding
                    <br>reserved for the
                    writing and editing of code per se. <mark>Sometimes software
                        development
                        is known as software engineering</mark>, especially when
                    it
                    employs formal
                    methods or follows an engineering <br>design process.

                <p>The first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when
                    mathematician Ada Lovelace published an algorithm to
                    calculate a
                    sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by
                    <br>Charles
                    Babbage's Analytical Engine. However, Charles Babbage had
                    already
                    written his first program for the Analytical Engine in
                    1837<br><br>
                    In the 1880s, Herman Hollerith invented the concept of
                    storing data
                    in machine-readable form. Later a control panel (plug board)
                    added
                    to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be <br>programmed
                    for
                    different jobs, and by the late 1940s, unit record equipment
                    such as
                    the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by control panels
                    in a
                    similar way, as were the first <br>electronic computers.
                    However,
                    with
                    the concept of the stored-program computer introduced in
                    1949, both
                    programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same
                    way in
                    computer <br>memory.
