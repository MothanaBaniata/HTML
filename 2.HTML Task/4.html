        <p>A fish (pl.: fish or fishes) is an aquatic, craniate, gill-bearing
            animal that lacks limbs with digits. Included in this definition are
            the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as
            well as various extinct related groups. Approximately 95% of living
            fish species are ray-funned fish, belonging to the class
            Actinopterygii, with around 99% of those being teleosts.</p>
