            <p><u>Billions of dollars</u> are spent at sporting events, on
                sports teams, on sports events, as well as on sports-related
                equipment and apparel. This guide is devoted to those sports
                that are the largest in terms of monies at the professional
                level and as a result, not every sport is included. The primary
                focus is on the professional sports industry in the United
                States although there are a few instances in which the
                international aspects of the industry are mentioned. Because of
                the focus on professional sports, the Olympics and amateur
                events are not included.</p>

            <p><b>What is a healthy diet?</b></p>
            <p>Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying
                unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of the foods you
                love. Rather, it's about feeling great, having more energy,
                improving your health, and boosting your mood.</p>

            <p>While some extreme diets may suggest otherwise, we all need a
                balance of protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and
                minerals in our diets to sustain a healthy body. You don't need
                to eliminate certain categories of food from your diet, but
                rather select the healthiest options from cach category.
